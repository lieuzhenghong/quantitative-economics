## Teaching Arrangements
The suggested tutorial sequence commences in Week 2 and will lag the lectures by one week. The suggested tutorial work may provide more than enough material for a one hour tutorial. Tutors should consider which parts they wish to set for their students and may hold back the rest for revision exercises/vacation work/collection questions. Solutions will be made available to tutors via WebLearn.
